The music is too large to fit in the repository (278MB), and has been excluded from the git repository (.gitignore'd).
If you got the repository from the official complete release (aka if you see the music files in this folder) then this shouldn't apply to you.

However, for those who have cloned the git repository, these files are not included.
They are found on the 'Dreamcast Backup' set of 3 CDs under the path `F:\Frogger\music\`.
Copy the .wav files from that folder to this one. (But not the .adx files)
