4. Notes on CD CRAFT use
The following describes the items that require attention when using CD CRAFT.
The summarized contents of the manual described here are the minimum items that 
require your understanding. For further details, refer to the manual.

* The GD Writer and GD-R media are markedly delicate items compared to the 
  earlier CD-R. Be sure to pay full attention to this during use.


4.1 GD Writer handling
  (a) Place the drive in a stable location where it is not subjected to 
      vibrations.
      Do not place a hard disk, etc. on top of the GD Writer's enclosure.
  (b) GD Writer is the only device to be connected. Other SCSI devices 
      should be disconnected as possible.
      Also check the cable length, and the conditions of the cable and 
      terminator connections.


4.2 GD-R media handling
  (a) Before writing, use a blower to blow away dust adhering to the media.


4.3 System settings
  (a) Use the newest ASPI manager and SCSI drive
  (b) Set "automatic insertion" to OFF
      If the GD Writer is recognized as a CD-ROM device, set "automatic 
      insertion" to OFF on the Device Manager's CD-ROM device properties menu.
  (c) Check that "disconnect" is ON
      As in (b), check that "disconnect" is set to ON on the CD-ROM device 
      properties menu.


4.4 Conditions for executing the program
  (a) Close all other applications
  (b) Do not start tasks that run in the background, such as Screen Saver, 
      System Agent, Active Channel, etc.
  (c) Do not connect to a network


5. Limit of System Function
(1) Disk Writing
  Single dense area dummy track writing is not applicable to the current 
  version. 
  Single-density area dummy tracks are supported during the build operation.

(2) Emulation File Creation
  Emulation file creation does not apply to the current version.

(3) Image File Creation
  (a) Disk image file does not calculate ECC data for mode1 and form1 sectors.
      It always calculate EDC data.
  (b) One source file can be defined in file block (FileÅ`EndFile).
  (c) Directory cannot be created in CDDA track.
