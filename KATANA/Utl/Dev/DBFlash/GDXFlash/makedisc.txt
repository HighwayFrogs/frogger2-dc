	CREATING A GD-X FIRMWARE DISC

(1) CREATING A FIRMWARE DISC FOR VERSION V1.4.5D (or earlier)

Create a firmware upgrade GD-R using GD-Workshop or CD-Craft  with: 
FAD 171	gx1_4_7c.fsh 
		gx1_4_7c.pad
		 
Use system files v147c_sd.bin for SDA and v147c_hd.bin for HDA.

If you create a CDR with CD-Craft rather than GDR add 40 minutes of data after gx1_4_7c.pad


(2) CREATING A FIRMWARE DISC FOR VERSION V1.4.6B (or later)

Create a firmware upgrade CD-R using an ISO-9660 CD-R package with: 

		gx1_4_7c.fsh 
		gx1_4_7c.pad
		padding.bin (40 minutes of data)


NOTE: A Firmware disc created by method (1) will also work on versions v1.4.6b (or later)
