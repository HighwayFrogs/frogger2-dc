Metrowerks Command-Line Tools Release Notes
===========================================================================

Date:    February 21, 1999
Authors: Ed Swartz, Stephen Chong
	
===========================================================================
Usage and Configuration
===========================================================================

(General usage notes are in CLT_Usage_Notes.txt.)

For the SHx environment variables, OS is "" and ARCH is "SH", so
the default variables are "MWCSHIncludes" for the compiler, and
"MWSHLibraries" and "MWSHLibraryFiles" for the linker.

===========================================================================
Changes in This Version
===========================================================================

2000/03/03:

Replaced "-endian" option and changed default to little endian.

2000/02/21:

Removed "-endian" option since it's always set to little endian for 
Dreamcast.

Updated linker options to be compatible with the new linker.

1999/11/19:

Clarified documentation for "-ansi" option.  This is the same as specifying
"-enum xxx", "-stdkeywords xxx", and "-strict xxx".  

Moved compatibility options to bottom of C/C++ and backend option lists to
avoid confusion.

1999/11/18:

Made "-endian little" the default.  

1999/08/26:

Fixed crasher bug in linker where it tried to release memory
allocated to hold the command file twice.

1999/08/20:

Split the compiler into Embedded and Dreamcast versions.  The Dreamcast
compiler is called "mwshc" and has Hitachi-C compatible options compiled
in.  Standard Metrowerks options are still available and are preferred.

1999/06/11:

Added file mappings to assembler for "*.src" and "*.a".

1999/06/03:

Added "-constpool on|off" option to support const pool optimizations.  
Removed "-opt peep[hole]" which doesn't apply anymore.  Added support 
for "*.lcf" as a valid linker command file extension.

Bugs Fixed in This Version
===========================================================================

1999/11/18:

"-inline noauto" would turn off inlining altogether.

1999/06/15:

Enabled debugging options in linker ("-g", "-sym on").

1999/06/14:

Fixed bug where "-O3" and "-O4" would cause internal error messages.

1999/06/11:

Fixed the "-fp" option.  Emits an error if hardware floating point is 
used with any processor other than SH4.

1999/06/18:

Fixed bug in linker causing a crash when emitting an error message 
about mixed-endian files.
