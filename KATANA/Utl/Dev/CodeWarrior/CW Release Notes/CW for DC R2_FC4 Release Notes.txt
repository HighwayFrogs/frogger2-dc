========================================================================

Version: R2_FC4
Date:    March 2nd, 2000

========================================================================
New Features in This Version
========================================================================
* pragma section is implemented

* GBR related instructions are supported, see Targeting Dreamcast.pdf.

* more intrinsic instructions are supported, see Targeting Dreamcast.pdf.

========================================================================
Bugs Fixed in This Version
========================================================================
* fixed bug with inline assembler where STC.L instruction can't be compiled.

* fixed a bug with after storing unsigned char in register using mov.b 
instruction, should followed by unsigned extension. 

* fixed bug when using shift to replace multiplication, the intermediate node 
are duplicated, which caused compiling failed.

* fixed a bug when compiler handling type conversion from 8 bytes struct 
to 4 bytes struct incorrectly.

* fixed a bug where in inline assembler, the data value for data.w and data.l can't
be signed negative number.

* fixed a bug where intrinsic function ld_ext() being optimized incorrectly
at optimization level 1 and above.

* fixed a bug when there is a big if else statement, jump instruction read the
jump address from incorrect memory location.

* fixed bug "Bitfield sign extension instruction missing problem" from R2_FC3

* fixed bug "big switch case statement, sometimes jump instruction jump to 
  incorrect address"

* fixed bug "when there is a multiple inheritance, sometimes virtual function 
  doesn't get called correctly"

* fixed bug "child target check and uncheck "link column" report error message"

* fixed bug "target removing causing IDE crashing"

* when reading value of an element in Bitfield from memory, if the size of the
  that element is not bigger than a word, sometimes a sign extension instruction 
  is missing.

* when there is a big switch case statement, sometimes instruction doesn't read
  the jump address from correct memory 

* when there is a multiple inheritance, sometimes virtual function doesn't get called
  correctly

* #pragma section is not implemented

* when "Extra Comma" warning is checked in the prefs panel, not showing warning
  error when there is an extra comma in the program

* breakpoint deviate from source file line position when using line continue marker
  between the passing parameters of the function

* there is a linker error when there is a GROUP(ROOT)(.bss) in the linker 
  command file

* child target check and uncheck "link column" report error message

  Under "Target" tab, targetA and targetB are parallel, if we drag targetB
  to targetA, then check and uncheck the link column for targetA's child target
  targetB, then "File is not current target" error message reported

* target removing causing IDE crashing

  Under "Target" tab, targetA and targetB are parallel, if we drag targetB
  to targetA, then remove the targetB which is under the root, IDE crashes
