CodeWarrior for Dreamcast R2 Release Notes

Version: R2
Date:    15 July 1999

New Features in This Version

* Overlay support

* Make Strings Read Only option in SH Processor settings panel

* Functions may be linked in any order through the "function" LCF
  grouping directive.

* ".vtables" section that includes all the C++ virtual tables.

Bugs Fixed in This Version

* fixed a compiler bug where an 'if' statement could be wrongly eliminated
  by the compiler at optimization levels 3 and 4.

* fixed a compiler bug where accesses to a local variable in the stack frame
  would generate the wrong offset into the stack when that local variable
  was passed as a parameter to a function call.
  
* fixed a debugger bug that caused the IDE to crash when the user clicked on
  any filename in the global variable window that was associated with an
  array type variable in the the global variable list.
  
Known Bugs in This Version

* Link order changes when updating a project to R2.

  When a project is moved to the R2 release, the IDE changes the link order
  somewhat. The new link order is the order of the groups of files as they
  exist in the original project. The order within the group remains the
  same.
  
  For example, if there are two groups, "sources" and "objects", the new
  link order will be all the files included in the group "sources" followed
  by all the files included in the group "objects". 
  
  Because the existing project stationery groups all the Shinobi objects and 
  libraries under the same group, there should not be a change in the link
  order that can affect the execution of a Dreamcast application.

* Possible IDE crash when switching targets in the Project Window
  "Overlays" view.

  If a project includes a target that is not mapped to "SH Bare Linker",
  it is possible to crash the IDE.
  
  This crash occurs when you are in the "Overlays" view of the project
  window and have an SH target selected. In this condition, switching to the
  non-SH target will cause the IDE to crash.
  
  For example, if you open the Teapot project, switching to the "BUILD ALL"
  target in the condition listed above will crash the IDE.
  
  To switch to the non-SH target without crashing the IDE, change to either
  the "Files" or the "Targets" view of the Project window.
  
* IDE left in unstable state after selecting "Resume" when closing debug
  window.
  
  If you close the debug window with the control buttons while a process is
  still running, an alert dialog will pop up with three options, "Resume",
  "Kill", and "Cancel".
  
  Do not select "Resume", as this will leave the IDE in an unstable state.
  Select either "Kill" or "Cancel" instead.
   
* Possible crash when trying to run debugger when debugger is already running.

  If the debugger is running, and you try to start another debugging session,
  A message will pop up telling you that you can only run on project at a time.
  Killing the running debugger will cause the IDE to crash.

  Make sure you do not try to execute another debugging session to avoid this bug.

This text file includes release notes for the following versions of
CodeWarrior for Dreamcast
 
* CodeWarrior for Dreamcast FC4 


CodeWarrior for Dreamcast FC4 C/C++ Release Notes 

Components: Compiler, Linker, Assembler
Version:    R1-FC4
Date:       18 June 1999

New Features in This Version

* $REF_INCLUDE linker directive.
  All symbols and sections listed in a $REF_INCLUDE section in the
  linker command file will be forced in closure (included in the output)
  if the containing file is referenced.

     Example:

     $REF_INCLUDE
     {
             .rodata
     }

* For the assembler, endianess is read from the SH target preference
  panel if a file does not specify its endianess using a .endian
  directive
 
Bugs Fixed in This Version

* fixes a compiler bug with switch statement when the type of the switch
  expression is an unsigned int. In that case some case labels would not
  be found.

* fixes a compiler bug with type conversions of float to unsigned char
  and unsigned char to float

* fixes a compiler bug with type conversions of float to unsigned short
  and unsigned short to float

* fixes a compiler bug with the copy of a structure when the size of the 
  structure is more than 255 bytes.

* fixes a compiler bug where the register R0 used to return a function
  value would be overwritten.

* fixes an assembler bug where Immediate values which contained
  arithmetic expressions and used parenthesis where not expanded
  correctly.  

  For example, 

          add #8*(3*4),r1

  would cause an assembler error, but

          add #(8*3)*4,r1

  would assemble correctly.

* fixes an assembler bug where invalid macros would sometimes crash the
  assembler.
