GDWorkshop 2.9.0i
1) Save Scr, sometimes sub-directory is not included.
A directory having no files caused this, GDWorkshop needs to know that track the data files are
for there is no internal mechanism to ask a directory what track it belongs to the solution was to use the internal hidden file '.' which every directory has   (this enables us to have empty directories)


GDWorkshop 2.9.0h 
=============== 
1. When parsing a script file that do not contain a separator '.' have one added and a warning is issued

2.Scripts containing filesource's larger than 260 characters caused a GPF, this now produces an error message 
3.Recording Date only works within File & EndFile block
