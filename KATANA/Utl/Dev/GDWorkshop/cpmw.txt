cpmw

This is a small application that controls GD Workshop from within a Makefile.

To use the cpmw in a DOS box, enter :

cpmw [filename] -dsr param

Filename is optional.
If a filename is specified it is loaded when GD Workshop starts up.
If no filename is specified then GD Workshop starts up with no project loaded.

-d	open/close
This controls the door button and issues an open/close message.

-s	CD-ROM/GD-M
This controls the CD-ROM/GD-M switch and switches between the CD-ROM and emulator.

-r	update files to GD-M
Instructs GD Workshop to update to the GD-M any changed files.
It's like selecting the Link Check option in the File menu and then selecting Update to emulator.
