To run the script CreateProj.vbs 
A directory needs to be created on the GD drive. The script looks for removable drives
In this directory should be 5 further directories called
Track1
Track2
Track3
Track4
Track5
These contain the files for your project.
No files should be in the main directory 
The example does not handle subdirectories
IP.bin and IP0000.bin should be in root of the GD Drive.
The file that is named in the IP.bin (1st_read.bin) can be forced to be the last file.
Select the menu option 'Executable Script' from Tools Menu and choose CreateProj.vbs.
