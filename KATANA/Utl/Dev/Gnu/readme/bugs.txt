The compiler currently has a few bugs:

o Function inlining can crash the compiler
  (gcc/17554)

o Various other compiler crashes

o Loop optimization does very bad things occasionally - 
  sometimes it copies pointers to multiple registers.

If your code crashes the compiler, please send the code to 
dts@sega.com.
