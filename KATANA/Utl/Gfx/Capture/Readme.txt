DC Capture Tool
---------------

DC Capture requires a Set 5.24 connected to a PC to make
a screen capture.

Just run a Dreamcast application as usual on the 
development system and double-click the "DCCap.exe" icon.

The tool will open a mini-window with the following
buttons (listed from left to right):

1. Exit
2. Freeze and Capture
3. Capture while Playing
4. Play

Click a capture button to save an image.  The target
will temporarily halt while the frame buffer is copied
to the PC.  You will then be asked to specify a save
location and filename for the bitmap.

Screen captures are saved in 24-bit Windows ".bmp" format.

Note: The "Play" button is not able to recover from
most "Freeze and Capture" operations, so avoid freezing
the frame unless images exhibit tearing or smearing artifacts.
