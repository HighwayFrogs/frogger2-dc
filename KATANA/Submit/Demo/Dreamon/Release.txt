Please read documentation.

Please note that CDDA tracks have been removed from BUILD directory in
order to reduce the zip size to emailable size.

Please place dummy data in tracks 1 + 3.

OPEN ISSUES
===========
DDS does not handle DA track translation from a manual TOC read followed by
sector-based playback. Applications using this behavior may us
gsGDDALogicalToPhysical to identify the correct track to use to determine
sectors.
