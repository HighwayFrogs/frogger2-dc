Controllers and Control Ports</p>

<dir>
  </font><font COLOR="#800000"><blockquote>
    <p>With Dreamcast, the controller is not controlled by an ID. Instead, controller
    ownership information is returned together with the key (or button) signal, indicating
    whether it is from a keyboard (system), gun (system) or control (system).</font><br>
    <br>
    <font COLOR="#800000">By providing key (or button) control instead of control by ID, we
    are considering the compatibility of different types of controllers that may appear in the
    future, as long as the required operating buttons are supported in existing applications.<br>
    <br>
    In the following, a compatible controller refers to one that has the necessary keys (or
    buttons) for application operation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><blockquote>
    <p>Note: </b>Functions of the A/B and START buttons, and the ten digital keys, are the
    guaranteed minimum controller functions. The X/Y buttons of the standard controller, L/R
    trigger and the ten analogue keys are not guaranteed to be present.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><blockquote>
    <p>Note: </b>The minimum keys (or buttons) required to operate the application with the
    standard controller are stored in disc IP information as 16-bit data. (This includes A, B,
    X, Y, and START for soft reset.)<br>
    In addition, when key combinations differ from the above-mentioned required minimum keys
    because of changes in key configuration, the keys should be based on the contents of the
    initial settings.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <b><blockquote>
    <p>Note: </b>A hardware keyboard is not currently a supported controller (system), so
    there is no specification assigning, for example, the Z key as the standard controller A
    button, as it is in Saturn. Operations with a hardware keyboard are limited to key input,
    with other operations performed by other controllers connected separately.</p>

    <p>In past development standards, it was written that applications should not be allowed
    to &quot;start&quot; or operate from an incompatible controller, but from this version,
