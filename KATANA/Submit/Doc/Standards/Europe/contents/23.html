<blockquote>
  <p>TV Game Software Ethics Inspection Organisation</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Purpose)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The TV Game Software Ethics Inspection Organisation establishes the rules of ethics for
  the following purposes:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>- TV game software should be instructive and serve as wholesome amusement for society.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>- TV game software should obtain the support and confidence of society, and engender
  positive attitudes toward the approaching multimedia era.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>- Considering the effect of TV game software on young generations, a rating system
  standard has been developed for youths and their parents to judge purchases.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>- Game retailers should advise customers of the standard ratings of products.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>- A Developer's Guide is provided for software creators to adapt their software to
  society.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Scope of Application)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following items related to TV game software sold by manufacturers shall comply with
  the rules of the Organisation:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Content (images, voices, sound effects, language), expression and description</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) Title, packaged printed matter, packaging, advertising, storefront demonstrations
  and sales promotion materials</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The items in (1) are governed by inspection, and the items in (2) are regulated
  voluntarily pending the results of the inspection of (1), under the responsibility of each
  manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Changes to Regulations)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Organisation is continually concerned with trends in software products, flow of
  culture in society and advances in expressive technology, and assumes the duty and the
  right to change regulations as it deems appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Ethics Regulation Structures)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ethics regulations of the Organisation consist of the following:</p>

  products. The next two items apply to all of the ethics regulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethics Regulations for All Age Groups</b> Ethics regulations related to TV game
  software that is recommended for all ages.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>- Stimulation of cruelty and unruly behaviour in youth is prohibited.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>- Content that might incite misbehaviour, crime and anti-social behaviour in youth is
  prohibited.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<blockquote>
  <p>Age-Dependent Ethics Regulations</b> Consumers over 18 years old who are considered
  wise enough to distinguish between a game world and real life are not the object of the
  regulations for TV game software that is not recommended for those under 18 years of age.</p>
