Perfect DC Retail Matches:
 ancients.spt
 city.spt
 garden.spt
 halloween.spt
 lab.spt
 super.spt
 generic.spt (Matches after using -w128 argument.)
 hub.spt (Works with -w256 after removing 'swamtrol.bmp', and renaming 'swamtrolold.bmp' to 'swamtrol.bmp'.)

TODO:
 - Make space/sub.spt match.
 
Unused Files in Textures\ on Retail:
 - Frogger2.pvr
 - retro.spt
 - Newbaby.spt
 - titles.spt
 - language.spt
 - garib.spt (Shared with PSX retail)

Non-Matching:
 space.spt (Doesn't match the backup (or retail) space.spt file.) AHOVER is encoded differently.
 sub.spt (Doesn't match the backup (or retail) sub.spt file.) JRAIL3 is encoded differently (like AHOVER for space)
 
These two nonmatches are odd. The AHOVER image is shared between multiple SPT files.
As such, we can see that the exact same ahover.bmp just outputs different bytes when in space.spt compared to generic.spt.
I suspect there may be some kind of memory corruption bug, or some other bug, since the files match perfectly outside of a small snippet of the image file.
